# Methods of AI - Coding Task

## Required Libraries
The program was developed and tested with `python 3.7.1` and the following libraries:
 - `numpy (1.16.0)`
 - `matplotlib (3.0.2)`
 - `tkinter (8.6)`

In most cases any somewhat recent versions of these libraries should be fine.

The program has been tested on Windows 10 and macOS Mojave.

## Usage
The main executable file is `gui.py`. The command to run the program is simply `python gui.py`.

Before running a search algorithm, the user needs to select a file containing the environment definition (warehouse file) and a file containing the problem to be solved (order file) via the two buttons at the top left of the GUI. After successfully selecting these files, the paths should be displayed in the two text cells below the buttons.
The files should have the format specified in the description of the programming task. There are no particular checks for correct syntax, the program might just crash if it receives invalid files.

The user can then choose one of the provided search algorithms from the first dropdown menu. If applicable, the user can also select the desired number of beams (in case of local beam search) or threads (in case of parallel hillclimbing) from the second dropdown menu.

To start the search, press the `Start` button. While the search is in progress, the program **will not be responsive**. When the search is finished, the found solution will be displayed in the large text area on the left.
